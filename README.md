# ThemePark
The JUNGLE KINGDOM theme park is one of the most popular theme parks in the Southern hemisphere and is located right here in South Africa. JUNGLE KINGDOM is home to one of the biggest rollercoasters in the world. Families from all over the globe would come to visit this thriller theme park to experience the thrill you wouldn’t experience 	in any other theme park. Some customers would book the entire theme park for events such as birthday parties, celebratory events, etc. 

Although this theme park is one of world’s biggest, the existing system can no longer keep up with the business’ requirements. The following crucial business processes are not automated:
-The sale of tickets
-Booking of events 
Furthermore, the reporting system that is currently in place has become obsolete, e.g. No monthly cost report, no maintenance report or customer satisfaction report. 
The existing system also doesn’t keep track of the average amount of people visiting the theme park on a monthly basis. 
With the competition heating up, digital functionality is essential to make sure that everything is run smoothly.
